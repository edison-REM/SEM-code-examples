# Load packages:
library("dplyr") # I always load this
library("lavaan")
library("semPlot")

# Read the data:
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) 
Data <- read.csv("StarWars.csv", sep = ",")

# Final model:
Model2 <- '
Prequels =~ Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q1
Original =~ Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q1
Sequels =~ Q8 + Q9 + Q10 + Q1
Q4 ~~ Q10
'

# Let's fit the model using scaling in latent variable variance, it makes raw parameters a bit easier to interpret:
fit2b <- cfa(Model2, Data, std.lv=TRUE)

# Plot with semPlot:
semPaths(fit2b, "std", "est")

# We can make this nicer. First let's define the node labels:
nodeNames <- c(
  "I am a huge Star Wars\nfan! (star what?)",
  "I would trust this person with\nmy democracy (Jar-Jar Binks).",
  "I enjoyed the story of\nAnakin's early life.",
  "The special effects in\nthis scene are awful (Battle of Geonosis).",
  "I would trust this person\nwith my life (Han Solo).",
  "I found Darth Vader's big\nreveal in 'Empire' one of the greatest\nmoments in movie history.",
  "The special effects in\nthis scene are amazing (Death Star\nExplosion).",
  "If possible, I would definitely buy\nthis droid (BB-8).",
  "The story in the Star\nWars sequels is an improvement to\nthe previous movies.",
  "The special effects in\nthis scene are marvellous (Starkiller\nBase Firing).",
  "Prequel trilogy",
  "Original trilogy",
  "Sequel trilogy"
  )

# Now we can plot:
semPaths(fit2b,
    what = "std", # this argument controls what the color of edges represent. In this case, standardized parameters
    whatLabels = "est", # This argument controls what the edge labels represent. In this case, parameter estimates
    style = "lisrel", # This will plot residuals as arrows, closer to what we use in class
    residScale = 8, # This makes the residuals larger
    theme = "colorblind", # qgraph colorblind friendly theme
    nCharNodes = 0, # Setting this to 0 disables abbreviation of nodes
    manifests = paste0("Q",1:10), # Names of manifests, to order them appropriatly.
    reorder = FALSE, # This disables the default reordering
    nodeNames = nodeNames, # Add a legend with node names
    legend.cex = 0.5, # Makes the legend smaller
    rotation = 2, # Rotates the plot
    layout = "tree2", # tree layout options are "tree", "tree2", and "tree3"
    cardinal = "lat cov", # This makes the latent covariances connet at a cardinal center point
    curvePivot = TRUE, # Changes curve into rounded straight lines
    sizeMan = 4, # Size of manifest variables
    sizeLat = 10, # Size of latent variables
    mar = c(2,5,2,5.5), # Figure margins
    filetype = "pdf", width = 8, height = 6, filename = "StarWars" #  Save to PDF
    )

# Some other things we can do with semPlot is do some algebra:
semMatrixAlgebra(fit2b, Lambda) # Obtain factor loadings
semMatrixAlgebra(fit2b, Psi) # Obtain latent variance-covariance matrix
semMatrixAlgebra(fit2b, Theta) # Obtain residual variance-covariance matrix
semMatrixAlgebra(fit2b, Lambda %*% Psi %*% t(Lambda) + Theta) # Obtain Sigma

# And we can generate lavaan syntax:
semSyntax(fit2b)
